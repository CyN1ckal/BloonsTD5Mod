# Bloons Tower Defense 5 Mod
This tool allows for several modifications to the normal Bloons Tower Defenes 5 game (Steam). So far it is very basic with just only a few features. It allows you to change things such as Monkey Money, In-Game Lives, In-Game Money, Player Rank, and Player Experience.

Compile the project as an x86 DLL and inject it into BTD5-Win.exe process with an injector of your choice.
Or if you are too lazy to compile yourself, download the latest release. No guarantee it is actually the latest.
